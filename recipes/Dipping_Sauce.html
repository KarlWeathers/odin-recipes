   <h1>Description</h1>
   <p>Nước Chấm, also known as Nước Mắm Chấm or Nước Mắm Đường Ớt, is an essential and versatile sauce in Vietnamese cuisine. This sauce is a true finishing touch that elevates a dish from ordinary to extraordinary and many Vietnamese dishes are incomplete without it.</p>
   <h1>Ingredients</h1>

   <ul>
    <li>1 cup hot water</li>
    <li>3/4 cup granulated sugar</li>
    <li>3 tablespoons lime juice (about 1 fresh lime)</li>
    <li>1 cup coconut soda (Coco Rico brand)</li>
    <li>3/4 cup fish sauce (Viet Huong's Three Crabs brand)</li>
    <li>6 garlic cloves (thinly slice or smash with a garlic press)</li>
    <li>2 Thai chili peppers (thinly slice)</li>
   </ul>
  
<h1>Steps</h1>
<ol>
    <li>Combine hot water and sugar. Mix until dissolved.</li>
    <li>Add lime juice, coconut soda, fish sauce, garlic, and chili peppers. Mix until combined.</li>
    <li>Remember to taste test. If the sauce is too sweet, add a bit more fish sauce. Too salty? Add sugar. Still missing something? It probably needs a tad more lime juice.</li>
    <li>Storage: You can prepare the sauce in advance and it will last up to 5 days in the fridge. If you are leaving it for longer, leave out the garlic and chili peppers. Add garlic and chili peppers right before serving.</li>
</ol>
