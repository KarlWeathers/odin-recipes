   <h1>Description</h1>
   <p>Sometimes called spring rolls, other times called egg rolls, chả giò is a popular Vietnamese appetizer of bite-size crispy goodness. You've probably seen them in Vietnamese restaurants. Now try to make them at home!</p>
   <h1>Ingredients</h1>
   <h1>Pork Filling</h1>
   <ul>
    <li>2 lbs ground pork</li>
    <li>½ cup dried woodear mushrooms</li>
    <li>2 oz dried bean thread vermicelli/cellophane noodles</li>
    <li>2 green onions (trim off ends and slice thinly)</li>
    <li>1 small white/yellow onion (peel and finely dice)</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon granulated sugar</li>
    <li>¼ teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
    <li>2 teaspoons sesame oil</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon sea salt</li>
    <li>3 tablespoons oyster sauce</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon chicken bouillon powder</li>
   </ul>
   <h1>Egg Roll Wrapers</h1>
   <ul>
    <li>Spring Roll Pastry Wrappers
    </li>
    <li>1 beaten egg yolk (to seal egg rolls)</li>
</ul>
<h1>Steps</h1>
<ol>
    <li>In the same bowl, rehydrate dried woodear mushroom and bean thread vermicelli/cellophane noodles in hot water for 10 minutes or until softened. Remove from water and finely mince. Set aside.</li>
    <li>In a medium-sized bowl, mix together ground pork, wood ear mushroom, vermicelli noodles, green onions, white/yellow onion, sugar, black pepper, sesame oil, salt, oyster sauce, and chicken bouillon powder. Set aside.</li>
    <li>Thaw out the egg roll wrappers if frozen. Separate into individual sheets by pulling them apart slowly to prevent tearing. There will be one side of the sheet with a hard edge (the side that connects all the egg roll wrappers together). Tear or cut off that hard edge so that all sides are the same thickness.</li>
    <li>Use about 2 tablespoons of filling for each egg roll and follow the step-by-step picture instructions above on how to wrap egg rolls.</li>
    <li>In a wok or tall skillet, heat vegetable oil to 325°F. Fry in small batches for 2-3 minutes or until egg rolls are golden brown. Transfer egg rolls onto a wire rack to drain off excess oil.</li>
    <li>Serve immediately with Vietnamese Fish sauce dipping sauce (Nuoc Mam Cham). You can eat the egg rolls by themselves or wrapped with lettuce and assorted Vietnamese herbs such as sorrel (rau chua), fish mint (diep ca), Vietnamese coriander (rau ram), and perilla (tia to). Leftover egg rolls can be frozen and deep-fried straight from the freezer. Frozen egg rolls take about 6-7 minutes to cook.</li>
